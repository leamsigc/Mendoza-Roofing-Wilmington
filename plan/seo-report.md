# Strategic SEO Audit Report: RoofingMendoza.com

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

RoofingMendoza.com demonstrates solid foundational SEO health with an **87.15 on-page score** and established brand rankings for "mendoza roofing" (position #5, 480 monthly searches). The site has 68 backlinks from 54 referring domains, providing reasonable domain authority for a local roofing contractor. However, the site is severely underperforming on high-value commercial keywords—ranking #81-93 for "wilmington nc roofers" (1,900/mo) and "roofing contractors wilmington nc" (1,600/mo) represents a massive missed opportunity worth an estimated **$2,000-5,000/month in equivalent paid traffic value**.

The biggest threat is the competitive gap: competitors dominate page 1 for high-intent local keywords while Mendoza languishes on pages 8-10. The biggest opportunity is the low keyword difficulty (KD 0-20) for these terms combined with existing brand authority. With targeted content optimization and local SEO improvements, a realistic 3-month projection is moving 3-5 keywords from page 8+ to page 2-3, potentially **doubling organic traffic from ~95 to 200+ monthly visits**.
