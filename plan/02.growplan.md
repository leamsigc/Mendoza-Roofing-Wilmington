## Immediate Priorities (Week 1)

1. Update Google Business Profile (GEO) with 20+ high-res photos of recent projects in Wilmington and Supply, NC, tagged with local metadata.

2. Create three SEO landing pages specifically targeting 'TPO Commercial Roofing Wilmington', 'Hardie Board Siding Brunswick County', and 'Emergency Roof Repair Supply NC'.

3. DM 50 Wilmington-based real estate agents on LinkedIn offering a 'Priority 24-Hour Inspection' service for their active listings.

4. Post a 'Local Contractor Warning' thread in r/Wilmington and r/NorthCarolina detailing what to look for in post-storm roofing scams (positioning Mendoza as the 50-year trusted expert).

5. Launch a $10/day Google Search Ad campaign targeting the keyword 'roofing estimates near me' specifically within a 25-mile radius of Wilmington.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

1. Risk 1: High CPC in local roofing ads. Mitigation: Focus on long-tail keywords like 'TPO repair' or 'Hardie plank installation' rather than generic 'roofer'.

2. Risk 2: Low Reddit engagement/backlash for 'self-promotion'. Mitigation: Provide genuine value/advice on roof maintenance before mentioning services.

3. Risk 3: Seasonality of roofing leads. Mitigation: Use LinkedIn to build year-round commercial maintenance contracts with warehouse managers to offset residential dips.

## Success Signals

- ✓ Increase in Google Business Profile 'Direction Requests' and 'Calls' by 25% within 60 days.
- ✓ Ranking on Page 1 for 'Hardie Board Siding Wilmington' (targeting competitor USA Roof Masters' gap).
- ✓ Securing at least 5 referral partnerships with local real estate agencies via LinkedIn outreach.
- ✓ Organic traffic growth from 63 to 300+ monthly visits via local SEO landing pages.
