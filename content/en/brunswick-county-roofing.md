## Common Roofing Issues in Brunswick County

Brunswick County's coastal environment creates specific challenges:

1. **Salt air corrosion** — galvanized nails and metal flashing can rust faster near the coast; we use marine-grade materials
2. **Wind damage** — standard 3-tab shingles can fail in 60+ mph winds; we recommend architectural shingles or metal for coastal homes
3. **Algae and moss** — humid subtropical climate causes biological growth; algae-resistant shingles are available
4. **Hurricane preparation** — insurance companies increasingly require verified hurricane-rated roofing
