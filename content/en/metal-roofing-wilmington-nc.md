Standing seam metal with hidden fasteners outperforms exposed-fastener systems in salt air. Use aluminum or Galvalume rather than standard galvanized steel near the coast."

          text: "For coastal Wilmington NC, we recommend standing seam aluminum with Kynar 500 coating for best salt air resistance, or Galvalume steel for homes more than a mile from the coast. Copper is premium-grade with exceptional corrosion resistance. Standard galvanized steel is not recommended near the coast."

## Why Metal Roofing Makes Sense in Coastal Wilmington

**Hurricane Resistance**: Standing seam panels resist 130-160+ mph winds — far superior to standard asphalt shingles.

**Salt Air Durability**: Aluminum and Kynar-coated steel resists coastal corrosion for decades.

**Lower Lifetime Cost**: Replace asphalt shingles 2-3 times over a metal roof's lifespan — often more economical long-term.

**Energy Efficiency**: Reflective metal panels reduce cooling costs by 10-25% in Wilmington's hot summers.

**Low Maintenance**: No granules, no curling, no algae. Inspect fasteners periodically and you're done.
