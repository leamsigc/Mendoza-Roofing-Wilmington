          "@type": "Answer"
          text: "We recommend residential roof inspections in Wilmington NC at least once per year, ideally in spring (after winter) and fall (before hurricane season). Additionally, schedule an inspection after any significant storm. Wilmington's coastal climate accelerates roof wear, so regular inspections catch small issues before they become expensive problems."
