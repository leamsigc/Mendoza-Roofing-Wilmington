### Roof Repair Questions

Repair costs range from $150-$500 for minor repairs, $500-$2,000 for moderate damage, and $2,000-$5,000+ for major repairs. See our [detailed roof repair cost guide](/blog/roof-repair-cost-wilmington-nc) for more information.

**6. How quickly can you respond to an active roof leak?**
For emergencies, we respond 24/7 — call [910-367-7628](tel:910-367-7628) immediately. For non-urgent repairs, we typically schedule within 1-5 business days.

**7. Can I delay a roof leak repair?**
We strongly advise against it. A small leak grows quickly — water spreads through insulation, rots wood framing, and can lead to mold. Early repair almost always costs less than waiting.

**8. How much does roof replacement cost in Wilmington NC?**
Most Wilmington NC homes: $12,000-$18,000 for architectural shingles, $18,000-$35,000+ for metal roofing. See our [2026 roof replacement cost guide](/blog/roof-replacement-cost-wilmington-nc) for all material cost ranges.

**9. How long does a roof replacement take?**
Most residential replacements: 1-3 days. Larger or more complex homes: 3-5 days. Commercial projects: 1-2+ weeks.

**10. When should I repair vs. replace my roof?**
Repair when: damage is isolated, roof is under 15 years old, and repair cost is under 30-40% of replacement. Replace when: multiple failure areas, widespread material deterioration, or your roof is at end-of-life.

---

### Insurance Questions

**11. Will my insurance cover roof repair or replacement?**
Insurance covers damage from sudden events (hurricanes, hail, wind, falling trees). Age or maintenance-related deterioration is typically not covered. We help document storm damage for your claim.

**12. Can Mendoza Roofing work with my insurance adjuster?**
Yes. We provide detailed written damage documentation and photos that support your insurance claim. We've worked with hundreds of insurance claims in Wilmington and Brunswick County.
