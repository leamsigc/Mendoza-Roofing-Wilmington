## Our Maintenance & Inspection Services

### Professional Roof Inspections
Our certified technicians perform thorough visual and hands-on roof inspections, checking:
- **Shingles & Panels** — looking for curling, cracking, missing sections, or granule loss
- **Flashing** — around chimneys, vents, skylights, and valleys where leaks most often start
- **Gutters & Drainage** — ensuring water is flowing away from your home properly
- **Decking & Underlayment** — checking for soft spots or moisture intrusion
- **Ridge & Hip** — confirming proper ventilation is in place

After every inspection, you receive a **written condition report with photos**, giving you a clear picture of your roof's health and any recommended action.

### Real Estate Inspection Reports
Buying or selling a home in Wilmington? Our roof reports are used by real estate agents, home buyers, and insurance adjusters across Brunswick County. We provide:
- Estimated remaining lifespan of the current roof
- Photo documentation of all visible issues
- Written repair or replacement recommendation
- Report turnaround within 48 hours

### Chimney Repair & Flashing
The chimney is one of the most common sources of roof leaks. We handle:
- **Chimney flashing replacement** — the metal seal between the chimney and roof
- **Brick pointing** — repairing crumbling mortar joints
- **Chimney cap installation** — prevents water, animals, and debris entry

### Roof Pressure Cleaning & Coating
Coastal North Carolina's climate promotes black algae and lichen growth on roof surfaces. Left untreated, this biological growth holds moisture and degrades shingles. We offer:
- **Soft-wash roof cleaning** — safely removes algae and moss without damaging shingles
- **Reflective roof coating** — extends existing roof life and improves energy efficiency for flat and low-slope roofs

### Preventative Maintenance Programs
We offer **annual maintenance contracts** for residential and commercial properties. Your contract includes:
- 2 roof inspections per year (spring and fall)
- Minor repairs (sealant, flashing, caulking) included at no extra charge
- Priority scheduling after major storms
- Discounted rates on any needed repairs or replacements

> **"The job is not done until you are satisfied!"** — Our guarantee to every Mendoza Roofing customer.

## Why Preventative Maintenance Matters in Coastal NC

The combination of storm season (July–November), intense UV, high humidity, and salt air creates a uniquely demanding environment for roofs in the Wilmington area. Annual maintenance:

- **Extends roof life by 5–10 years** — catching and fixing small issues before they spread
- **Protects your insurance coverage** — insurers can deny claims for "lack of maintenance"
- **Maintains warranty validity** — manufacturer warranties often require regular professional inspection
- **Prepares you for storm season** — you'll know your roof's exact condition before June
