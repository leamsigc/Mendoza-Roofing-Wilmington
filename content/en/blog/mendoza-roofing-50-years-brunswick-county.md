# Over 50 Years Serving Brunswick County, NC — The Mendoza Roofing Story

Some companies talk about being local. **Mendoza Roofing LLC lives it.**

Since **1974**, our team has been roofing homes and businesses in Supply, Wilmington, Shallotte, Oak Island, Leland, and throughout Brunswick County. Over 50 years of coastal weather. Thousands of roofs installed and repaired. Generations of homeowners who trust us with their most important investment.

This is our story.

## Founded in 1974

Mendoza Roofing was founded in 1974 in Supply, NC — long before Brunswick County became the booming residential market it is today. In those early days, the work was simple: show up on time, do the job right, use quality materials, and treat customers the way you'd want to be treated.

Those founding principles haven't changed in 50 years.

The company grew organically through word of mouth — the best kind of growth. Brunswick County is a community where reputation matters. You don't survive 50 years if you cut corners, use substandard materials, or don't stand behind your work.

## Building a Reputation on Integrity

What does 50 years in business mean?

It means we've roofed homes that have now passed to the next generation — and that generation calls us when their time comes. It means we've been through dozens of hurricane seasons alongside our Brunswick County neighbors. It means we know which materials hold up in coastal conditions and which ones don't.

**Our guarantee has always been simple:** *"The job is not done until you are satisfied."*

That's not marketing language — it's how we operate. Our crew doesn't pack up and leave until you're happy with the work.

## What Sets Mendoza Roofing Apart

### Deep Local Knowledge
We know Brunswick County's microclimates, building codes, and the specific challenges of roofing near the coast. What works in Raleigh doesn't always work in Supply or Oak Island.

### Licensed & Fully Insured
We are fully licensed in North Carolina and maintain both general liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage. This protects our customers and our workers.

### Local Crews — No Outsourcing
Every member of our crew is a local hire. We don't bring in unknown subcontractors from other states. When you hire Mendoza Roofing, you know who's working on your home.

### Service Area We Know
We serve:
- **Supply, NC** — our home base since 1974
- **Wilmington, NC** — roofing contractor in the region's largest city
- **Shallotte** — commercial and residential roofing
- **Leland** — serving the county's fastest-growing community
- **Oak Island, Southport, Brunswick beaches** — coastal specialists
- **All of Brunswick County** — we're your neighbor

## Our Community

Mendoza Roofing is more than a business — we're part of the Brunswick County community. We've reroofed churches, community centers, and local businesses. We've helped neighbors after hurricanes when they had nowhere else to turn. We've employed local workers whose families also live in this community.

Bruno Mendoza established the company on values that still guide us today: **hard work, integrity, pride in craftsmanship, and caring about the people and places we serve.**
