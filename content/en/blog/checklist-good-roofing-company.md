## Choosing the Right Roofer

Hiring a roofer is a big decision. Here is the Mendoza Roofing checklist to ensure you are protected:

1. **Required Liability and Workman’s Comp Insurance:** Never hire a company that doesn't cover its employees.
2. **State Licensed:** Ensure they are in good current standing with the state.
3. **Local Company:** Look for local crews who know the area and weather patterns.
4. **Years in Business:** We have over 50 years of experience.
5. **Dependable:** A good company keeps their word.
6. **Clear Contracts:** No hidden costs.

At Mendoza Roofing, we meet every single one of these criteria.
