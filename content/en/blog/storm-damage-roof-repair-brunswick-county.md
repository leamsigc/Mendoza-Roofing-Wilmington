          text: "Signs of storm damage on a Brunswick County roof include: missing, lifted, or cracked shingles visible from the ground; granules collecting in gutters after a storm; water stains inside your home; dented or bent flashing and vents; sagging roof sections; or exterior structural damage. If you experienced a significant storm, schedule an inspection even if no damage is visible — hidden damage can worsen over time."

## Types of Storm Damage We Repair in Brunswick County

### Hurricane & Tropical Storm Damage
Brunswick County is in the direct path of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. Major storms can cause:
- Partial or complete roof blow-off
- Widespread shingle displacement
- Structural damage from wind-lifted sections
- Water intrusion throughout the home
- Fallen trees causing impact damage

After a major hurricane, Mendoza Roofing deploys teams throughout Brunswick County to help affected homeowners — prioritizing emergency tarping and stabilization, then permanent repairs.

### Wind Damage
Even non-tropical winds of 50-70+ mph (which Brunswick County experiences multiple times per year) can:
- Lift and remove 3-tab shingles in large sections
- Displace ridge caps and hip shingles
- Bend and pull flashing away from vulnerable areas
- Create stress cracks in rigid roofing materials

### Hail Damage
Hail damage on Brunswick County roofs is often invisible from the ground but significant:
- Dents and bruising on asphalt shingles accelerate wearcolorado
- Broken granule coating exposing asphalt underlayer
- Cracked or split shingles at hail impact points
- Dented flashing, gutters, and vents
- Pitting and cracking on tile roofing

**Important**: Hail damage often isn't noticed until the next heavy rain reveals a leak. If you experienced a significant hail storm, schedule an inspection before the next hurricane season.

### Fallen Tree & Debris Impact
Trees and heavy debris can punch through roofing systems instantly. Tree impact repairs often require:
- Emergency tarping to prevent further water damage
- Structural assessment of damaged decking and rafters
- Partial or full section replacement
- Careful debris removal to prevent further damage
