### Why a Local Roofing Contractor Matters in Wilmington, Supply & Brunswick County

Coastal North Carolina's weather—hurricanes, salt-laden breezes,
and heavy summer rains—puts extra strain on roofs.
A contractor who understands the region's specific challenges can prevent costly damage and extend your roof's lifespan.
In Wilmington, Supply, and all of Brunswick County,
the best roofing companies are those that have years of experience working with local materials, building codes, and the unique needs of our coastal homes.

### The 15 Questions You Must Ask Before Hiring a Roofing Contractor

#### 1. **Are you licensed and insured in North Carolina?**
   - A reputable contractor will display a valid NC roofing license and carry general liability, workers' comp, and builder's risk insurance. Ask for proof.

#### 2. **How long have you been in business?**
   - Local expertise often comes from a history of working in the area. A contractor with 10+ years in the region knows common failure points and repair best practices.

#### 3. **Do you have North Carolina-specific references?**
   - Request at least three recent local references (preferably homeowners in Wilmington or Brunswick County). Follow up with the references yourself.

#### 4. **What roofing materials do you recommend for my roof type and climate?**
   - Coastal winds favor metal or impact-rated shingles; older asphalt roofs may need replacement rather than repair.

#### 5. **Will you remove the old roof before installing a new one?**
   - Removing the old layer ensures proper flashing, underlayment, and a clean surface for the new roof. Skipping this step can lead to premature failure.

#### 6. **What warranty do you offer on workmanship and materials?**
   - Look for a written warranty covering both the contractor's labor and the manufacturer's product. A 5-year workmanship warranty is a good benchmark.

#### 7. **Can you provide a detailed written estimate?**
   - A good estimate lists every material, the number of hours of labor, and the total price. Avoid contractors who give only a ballpark figure.

#### 8. **Do you use subcontractors, and are they licensed?**
   - If you hire a general contractor, ensure any subcontractors they bring in are vetted and covered by your main contract.

#### 9. **What's your process for handling insurance claims?**
   - A reliable contractor will help you file a claim, document damage, and coordinate with the adjuster without charging extra.

#### 10. **What time-of-day or season rates apply?**
   - Emergency repairs (e.g., after a storm) usually cost more than scheduled work. Knowing the rate helps budget.

#### 11. **How do you protect my property during installation?**
   - Look for tarps, walk-on pads, and careful handling of gutters, landscaping, and belongings.

#### 12. **Do you offer a post-project inspection?**
   - A final walk-through ensures the work meets standards and any issues are corrected.

#### 13. **Can I see a copy of your permits?**
   - Proper permits are required for roof replacements; the contractor should provide them.

#### 14. **Do you have a history of on-time completions?**
   - Ask about typical project timelines—most residential roofs are finished in 1-3 days.

#### 15. **Are you certified for the roofing systems you install?**
   - Look for certifications from manufacturers such as GAF, CertainTeed, or certified “Fortified” roofing programs.

### What to Look For: Licenses, Insurance, & Experience

- **License**: Search the N.C. State Board of Examiners for Contractors (“roofing contractor” license) to confirm it's active.
- **Insurance**: A licensed contractor should carry a minimum of $500k general liability and workers' comp.
- **Experience**: 10+ years in the area means they've seen the full cycle of coastal weather damage.
- **Warranty**: A solid warranty protects you if problems arise within a year of installation.

### Common Roof Problems in Wilmington, Supply & Brunswick County

- **Wind damage**: Missing or curled shingles, lifted flashing.
- **Hail damage**: Denting metal roofs, cracking asphalt tiles.
- **Moisture & mold**: Leaks from faulty flashing or clogged gutters.
- **Salt corrosion**: Metal gutters, fascia, and flashings deteriorate faster along the coast.

Recognizing these issues early lets you negotiate a fair repair price and avoid costly replacements.

### Tips to Save Money & Avoid Scams

1. **Don't wait for a leak to get big.** A $200 repair now can prevent a $5,000 replacement later.
2. **Schedule bi-annual inspections**, especially after winter storms.
3. **Clean gutters and downspouts** each spring and fall to prevent water backup.
4. **Never waive your deductible** - it's illegal and undermines your insurance.
5. **Avoid “storm chasers”** who show up after a hurricane with low-ball offers; verify their credentials first.
