## What Affects Your Roof Replacement Cost in Wilmington

### 1. Roof Size
Measured in "squares" (100 sq ft each), your roof's total area is the biggest cost driver. An 1,800 sq ft house typically has 22-26 squares of actual roof area depending on pitch and overhangs.

### 2. Roofing Material
A standing seam metal roof costs 2-3x more than architectural shingles for the same house — but lasts 2-3x as long in the Wilmington coastal climate.

### 3. Roof Pitch and Complexity
Steeper pitches require special equipment and take longer. Complex roofs — multiple valleys, hips, dormers, skylights — cost more than simple gable roofs.

### 4. Number of Layers to Remove
NC building code allows a maximum of 2 layers of shingles. If your existing roof has 2 layers, both must be removed before re-roofing — adding $500-$1,500 in labor and disposal.

### 5. Decking Condition
We inspect decking (OSB or plywood) after tear-off. Rotted, soft, or damaged sections must be replaced. In Wilmington's humid climate, we find some level of decking damage on roughly 30-40% of re-roof projects.

### 6. Coastal Premium
Homes within 1-2 miles of the coast require marine-grade materials and additional storm-proofing measures. This typically adds 5-15% to the base cost.

## When Is Roof Replacement Worth It vs. Repair?

A general rule of thumb used by most Wilmington roofing contractors:

> **If repair cost exceeds 30-40% of replacement cost, replacement is often better value.**

Additional factors favoring replacement:
- Your roof is 18+ years old (asphalt in coastal NC climate)
- Multiple failing areas, not just one isolated spot
- You're planning to sell the home within 3 years
- You want to upgrade materials for storm resistance

## How to Get an Accurate Roof Replacement Quote in Wilmington NC

Never accept a roof replacement quote without a professional in-person inspection. Online calculators are notoriously inaccurate — they don't account for:
- Actual roof complexity
- Number of penetrations
- Current decking condition
- Local labor market prices
- Specific material availability
