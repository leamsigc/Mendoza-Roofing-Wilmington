          text: "Consider commercial roof replacement in Wilmington NC when: your roof is 15-20+ years old for a flat system, you're experiencing multiple leak points in different areas, repair costs exceed 40-50% of replacement costs, the membrane shows widespread deterioration like widespread cracking, brittleness, or delamination, or after a major storm event with extensive damage. For isolated leaks, seam failures, or punctures on a younger roof, repair is usually sufficient."

## Common Commercial Roofing Systems in Wilmington NC

Most commercial buildings in Wilmington have **flat or low-slope roofs** requiring specialized systems. Here's what you need to know about each:

### TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) — Most Popular
TPO has become the dominant commercial roofing system in Wilmington for several reasons:
- **Highly reflective** — the white membrane reflects up to 80% of solar radiation, significantly reducing cooling costs in Wilmington's hot climate
- **UV resistant** — holds up well in intense southeastern sun
- **Flexible** — accommodates building movement and temperature fluctuations
- **Weldable seams** — heat-welded seams are stronger than adhesive
- **Typical lifespan**: 15-25 years with proper maintenance

### EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) — Durable & Cost-Effective
Black rubber membrane that has been a commercial standard for 50+ years:
- Highly durable and temperature-resistant
- Lower initial cost than TPO
- Very long track record — well-understood performance characteristics
- Handles Wilmington's heat and UV well
- **Typical lifespan**: 20-30 years

### Modified Bitumen — Heavy-Duty Performance
Two- or three-layer system for high-performance applications:
- Excellent for high-traffic roofs (rooftop HVAC access, equipment)
- Multi-layer redundancy for enhanced leak protection
- Can be torch-applied, cold-applied, or self-adhered
- **Typical lifespan**: 15-25 years

### EDS Waterproof Membrane Systems — Premium Coastal Option
Mendoza Roofing is an **approved EDS installer**. These systems provide premium waterproofing protection, especially valuable for Wilmington commercial properties where water management is critical due to:
- High annual rainfall (54+ inches)
- Storm surge and wind-driven rain events
- Coastal humidity causing more aggressive moisture challenges

## Commercial Roof Maintenance in Wilmington NC

The single biggest thing you can do to protect your commercial roof investment is commit to **regular professional maintenance**. Industry data consistently shows:

> Commercial roofs with maintenance programs last 40-50% longer than neglected roofs.

**What a commercial roof inspection includes:**
- Full membrane surface assessment
- Seam and edge detail inspection
- Drain and scupper evaluation
- HVAC curb and penetration inspection
- Flashing condition assessment
- Photo-documented inspection report
- Prioritized maintenance recommendations

**How often should you schedule commercial roof maintenance?**
- **Semi-annually** (spring and fall) — recommended for most Wilmington commercial properties
- **After major storms** — any hurricane, tropical storm, or severe weather event
- **Annually minimum** — bare minimum to preserve warranty and extend life

## Commercial Roof Repair vs. Replacement in Wilmington NC

Knowing when to repair vs. replace is critical to managing your roofing budget:

### Repair is the right choice when:
- The leak is isolated to a specific area
- The membrane is generally in good condition
- Your roof is less than 15 years old
- Repair scope is less than 30-40% of replacement cost

### Replacement is the right choice when:
- Multiple failure points across the roof surface
- Widespread membrane deterioration
- Roof is at or past its design life
- The cost of continued repairs exceeds replacement economics
- Your building is undergoing major renovation
