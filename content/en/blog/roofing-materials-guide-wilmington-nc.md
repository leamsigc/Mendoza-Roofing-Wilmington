          text: "The best roofing material for Wilmington NC depends on your budget and goals. For most homeowners, architectural asphalt shingles (Class 3 or 4, wind-rated 110-130 mph) offer the best combination of cost and performance. For maximum longevity and storm resistance near the coast, standing seam aluminum metal roofing is the top choice. Contact Mendoza Roofing for a personalized recommendation based on your specific home."

          "@type": "Answer"
          text: "Asphalt shingles in Wilmington NC typically last 15-20 years for standard 3-tab shingles and 20-28 years for architectural shingles. This is shorter than the same products installed inland, due to salt air, higher UV exposure, and more frequent storm events. Proper installation, ventilation, and annual maintenance extends shingle life in coastal environments."

## 1. Asphalt Shingles

Asphalt shingles are by far the most common roofing material throughout Wilmington NC — affordable, widely available, and sufficient for most homes when the right product is selected.

### 3-Tab Asphalt Shingles
The entry-level option. A single flat layer of shingles with cutouts creating the appearance of three separate shingles.

**In Wilmington**: We no longer recommend 3-tab shingles for coastal installations. They typically last only 12-18 years here (vs. 20-25 inland) and are rated for only 60-80 mph winds — well below what Wilmington storms regularly produce.

### Architectural (Laminate) Shingles
Double-layer construction for a dimensional appearance, greater weight, and significantly better performance.

**In Wilmington**: The baseline recommendation for most homes. Choose products rated Class F (110 mph) or better, with algae-resistant coating (copper granules). Expected lifespan: 18-25 years with proper installation and maintenance.

### Impact-Resistant (Class 4) Shingles
Engineered to withstand direct hail impact without cracking. Often qualify for insurance discounts of 10-25%.

**In Wilmington**: Excellent choice for storm-prone areas. The additional cost ($2,000-$4,000 over standard architectural) is often recovered through insurance savings within 5-7 years.

## 2. Metal Roofing

Metal roofing is growing rapidly in Wilmington due to its outstanding storm performance, long lifespan, and low maintenance requirements.

### Corrugated Metal (Exposed Fastener)
Corrugated or ribbed panels with screws visible on the surface.

**In Wilmington**: Adequate for many applications, but exposed fasteners with rubber washers can fail over time in coastal UV and heat. Requires periodic re-fastening to maintain weathertightness. Not recommended for high-end homes within a mile of the coast.

### Standing Seam Metal
Panels with concealed fasteners locked in raised seams — the gold standard for residential metal roofing.

**In Wilmington**: Our top recommendation for coastal homes. Recommended materials are aluminum (naturally corrosion-resistant) or Galvalume steel with Kynar 500 factory finish. Wind resistance of 130-160 mph, lifespan of 40-70 years.

---

## 3. Tile Roofing

Clay and concrete tile roofing offers exceptional durability and a distinctive Mediterranean aesthetic.

**In Wilmington**: Excellent structural durability in coastal conditions. The primary consideration is weight — tile is 2-5x heavier than asphalt and requires structural assessment of the roof framing before installation. Common in upscale Wilmington neighborhoods and large coastal homes.

---

## 4. Flat Roof Systems

Many Wilmington commercial buildings, as well as some residential homes with flat or low-slope sections, require specialized flat roofing systems.

### TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)
**Best for**: Commercial buildings, hot sunny climates. Highly reflective — ideal for Wilmington's summer heat. 15-25 year lifespan.

### EPDM (Rubber Roofing)
**Best for**: Residential flat sections, cost-effective commercial. Tough, UV-resistant, easy to repair. 20-30 year lifespan.

### Modified Bitumen
**Best for**: High-traffic flat roofs, areas with heavy foot traffic. Multi-layer protection system. 15-25 year lifespan.

## How to Choose the Right Roofing Material for Your Wilmington NC Home

Consider these factors:

1. **Budget**: What is your total available budget for this project?
2. **How long you plan to stay**: If selling in 5 years, architectural shingles make sense. If this is your forever home, metal may offer better long-term value.
3. **HOA restrictions**: Many Wilmington-area HOAs restrict roofing materials or colors.
4. **Distance from coast**: Homes within 1-2 miles of the ocean need marine-grade materials.
5. **Insurance**: Class 4 impact-resistant shingles or metal roofing may qualify for insurance discounts.
6. **Existing structure**: Heavy materials (tile, slate) require structural assessment.
