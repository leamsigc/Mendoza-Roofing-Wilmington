# How to File a Roof Insurance Claim in Wilmington, NC

After a major storm hits Wilmington or Brunswick County, knowing how to navigate the insurance claim process can make the difference between getting your roof fixed right and fighting with your insurer for months.

This guide walks you through the entire process — from the moment the storm ends to the day your new roof is installed.

---

## Step 1: Inspect for Damage Safely (Don't Go on the Roof)

**Immediately after the storm**, check for visible damage from the ground:

- Missing, lifted, or curling shingles
- Granule debris in gutters and downspouts
- Visible water stains on ceilings or walls inside the home
- Damaged fascia, soffits, or gutters
- Fallen tree limbs or debris on the roof surface

> **Do NOT climb on the roof yourself.** After a storm, a roof can be weakened in ways that aren't visible. Let a licensed professional inspect it safely.

---

## Step 2: Document Everything Before Any Repairs

Before you call your insurance company, document all visible damage:

- Take **time-stamped photos and video** of all damage from the ground
- Photograph any failed areas inside the home (wet drywall, stains, warped wood)
- Note the date and time of the storm
- Save any weather alerts, news articles, or National Weather Service data confirming the storm

This documentation is critical — it establishes that the damage is storm-related, not from age or poor maintenance.

---

## Step 3: Call a Professional Roofer for a Damage Assessment

Call **Mendoza Roofing LLC at [910-367-7628](tel:910-367-7628)** before you call your insurance company. Here's why:

- We provide a **free damage assessment** with written documentation
- We can identify storm-related damage that is not visible from the ground (damaged flashing, compromised underlayment, cracked decking)
- Our written report is professional documentation that supports your insurance claim
- We can advise on whether the damage is likely to be covered based on your roof's condition

Many Wilmington homeowners skip this step and then struggle when the insurer sends an adjuster who minimizes the damage.

---

## Step 4: Contact Your Insurance Company to File the Claim

Once you have documentation, call your insurance company (not a general hotline — call the direct claims line):

**Information you'll need:**
- Date of the storm
- Type of damage (wind, hail, falling tree, etc.)
- Policy number
- Documentation photos

Your insurer will assign a **claims adjuster** to visit your property. In North Carolina:
- Insurers must acknowledge a claim within **10 days**
- They must pay or deny within **30 days**

---

## Step 5: Be Present for the Adjuster's Inspection

When the adjuster comes, **have your roofing contractor present** if possible. This is critical:

- Your contractor can point out damage the adjuster might miss
- They can explain technical issues (like ice dam damage or wind-driven rain infiltration) in industry terms the adjuster understands
- If the adjuster's scope misses items, your contractor can immediately dispute it while they're still on-site

---

## Step 6: Understand Your Policy — ACV vs. RCV

North Carolina homeowners insurance typically uses one of two methods to pay out roof claims:

### Actual Cash Value (ACV)
- Pays out the current depreciated value of your roof
- If your roof is 15 years old, you'll receive a smaller payment
- Less common for newer policies but check if it applies to you

### Replacement Cost Value (RCV)
- Pays the full cost to replace your roof with a comparable one
- Initial payment is the ACV; the rest (called the "holdback") is released after the repair is complete
- Most preferred by homeowners

> Ask your agent specifically which method applies to your roof, and whether your deductible is a flat dollar amount or a **percentage of your home's insured value** (hurricane/wind deductibles in NC can be 1–5%).

---

## Step 7: Review the Settlement and Work with Your Contractor

Once your claim is approved, your insurer will issue a check. Before you sign any contracts:

- Get **2–3 written estimates** from local licensed contractors
- Make sure the contractor's scope of work matches the approved claim amount
- If the insurer's payment seems too low, your contractor can file a **supplemental claim** for missed items

**Mendoza Roofing can handle the supplemental claim process** on your behalf, ensuring no legitimate damage is left uncovered.

---

## Common Reasons Claims Are Denied in NC

1. **Pre-existing damage** — insurer claims the damage was there before the storm
2. **Maintenance neglect** — missing shingles or flashing that should have been fixed years ago
3. **Policy exclusions** — some policies exclude certain types of storms or roof ages
4. **Late reporting** — most policies require prompt notification after damage occurs

If your claim is denied, you have the right to request a **re-inspection**, hire a **public adjuster**, or escalate to the NC Department of Insurance.
