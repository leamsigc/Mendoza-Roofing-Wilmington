          "@type": "Answer"
          text: "Yes, metal roofing is often worth the investment in North Carolina — especially in coastal areas like Wilmington and Brunswick County. While the upfront cost is 2-3x that of asphalt shingles, metal roofs last 40-70+ years vs. 15-25 for shingles in coastal NC. Over a 50-year period, you may save significantly on replacements. Metal also provides superior hurricane resistance (130-160+ mph wind rating) and may qualify for homeowner's insurance discounts."

          "@type": "Answer"
          text: "For coastal North Carolina, standing seam aluminum with Kynar 500 factory coating is the best metal roofing option. Aluminum naturally resists the salt air corrosion that affects standard galvanized steel. Kynar coatings are highly UV-stable in NC's intense sun. Galvalume steel (zinc-aluminum alloy) is a good second option for homes more than a mile from the coast. Avoid standard galvanized steel in salt air environments."

# Metal Roofing in North Carolina: A Complete Guide

Metal roofing has grown from a niche product to the fastest-growing residential roofing category in North Carolina — and for good reason. In a state that experiences everything from intense summer heat to coastal hurricanes to occasional ice storms in the mountains, metal roofing's combination of longevity, wind resistance, and low maintenance is hard to beat.

This guide covers everything North Carolina homeowners need to know about metal roofing: types, costs, pros and cons, and what works best in our specific climate.

## Types of Metal Roofing Available in NC

### 1. Standing Seam Metal Roofing
The gold standard of residential metal roofing. Panels run vertically with concealed fasteners locked in raised seams.

**Pros:**
- No exposed fasteners to fail
- 50-70 year lifespan
- Outstanding wind resistance (130-160+ mph)
- Elegant, modern appearance
- Best option for coastal NC environments

**Cons:**
- Highest upfront cost among metal systems
- Requires specialized installation experience
- Expansion/contraction noise can be noticed in new installations (settles over time)

**Best for:** Coastal and upscale homes, forever homes, anyone prioritizing long-term value

### 2. Corrugated Metal Roofing (Exposed Fastener)
Corrugated or ribbed panels with visible screws and rubber washers.

**Pros:**
- More affordable than standing seam
- Widely available
- Easy to install and repair
- Good for agricultural and light commercial

**Cons:**
- Exposed fasteners can fail over time; require inspection
- Rubber washers degrade in NC's heat and UV
- Less suitable for coastal homes near salt air

**Best for:** Rural homes, agricultural buildings, those on tighter budgets

### 3. Metal Shingles and Tiles
Stamped metal panels designed to replicate the look of asphalt shingles, slate, or tile.

**Pros:**
- Traditional appearance with metal durability
- Hidden fastener installation
- Good option where HOA restricts standing seam profiles
- 40-60 year lifespan

**Best for:** HOA communities, homes blending into established neighborhoods

### 4. Copper Roofing
The premium choice, developing a distinctive green patina over time.

**Pros:**
- 100+ year lifespan
- Zero corrosion in even the most coastal environments
- Striking appearance
- Completely recyclable

**Cons:**
- Significantly more expensive than other options
- Electrolytic contact with other metals must be avoided

**Best for:** Luxury homes, accent sections (dormers, bay roofs, accents)

**Standing Seam Metal:**
- Initial cost: $28,000
- No replacement needed (50+ year lifespan)

**Net savings with metal over 50 years: $15,000-$20,000+ in many scenarios** — plus less disruption to your life.

## Why Metal Roofing Is Especially Valuable in Coastal NC

North Carolina's coastal communities — including Wilmington, Brunswick County, and the Crystal Coast — face specific conditions where metal roofing excels:

1. **Hurricane resistance**: Metal stands up to wind speeds that scatter asphalt shingles
2. **Salt air**: Aluminum and properly coated Galvalume steel resist coastal corrosion
3. **UV exposure**: Metal reflects rather than absorbs solar radiation
4. **Rainfall**: No granule loss, no water absorption; metal sheds water cleanly
5. **Algae resistance**: Smooth metal panels don't support biological growth
