## Types of Roof Repairs We Handle in Wilmington NC

### Roof Leak Repair
Active leaks need immediate attention — water damage spreads quickly through insulation, wood framing, and ceilings. We locate and repair:
- Skylight and chimney flashing leaks
- Valley leak failures
- Pipe boot and vent seal failures
- Ice dam-related backups (rare in Wilmington but possible in winter)
- Broken shingle seal strips

### Storm Damage Repair
Wilmington's coastal position means frequent exposure to tropical storms, severe thunderstorms, and hurricanes. We repair:
- Wind-lifted or blown-off shingles
- Hail damage — dents, cracks, and granule loss
- Fallen limb/tree impact damage
- Debris impact injuries to roofing materials
- Flashing and ridge cap displacement

### Shingle Repair & Replacement
- Replacing missing, cracked, or curled shingles
- Re-nailing lifting shingles
- Patching damaged sections while blending with existing roof

### Flashing Repair
Flashing is the #1 cause of roof leaks in Wilmington NC:
- Step and counter flashing around chimneys
- Valley flashing replacement
- Pipe boot and vent flashing sealing
- Drip edge repair and replacement

### Flat Roof Repair
For commercial and residential flat sections:
- TPO/EPDM membrane puncture repair
- Seam resealing
- Ponding water correction
- Blister and bubble repair

### Gutter-Related Repairs
Often the source of fascia and soffit damage:
- Gutter reattachment and realignment
- Fascia board replacement
- Soffit repair and repainting
- Downspout extension and drainage correction

## The Roof Repair Process at Mendoza Roofing

**1. Free Inspection**
We start with a thorough roof inspection to identify ALL problem areas — not just the obvious ones. Many roofs have multiple vulnerabilities, and addressing only the symptom often leads to repeat calls.

**2. Written Estimate**
Before any work begins, you receive a clear, itemized written estimate with the scope of work, materials to be used, and total cost.

**3. Professional Repair**
Our trained local crews complete the repair using manufacturer-approved materials and techniques. We don't cut corners.

**4. Final Walkthrough**
We review the completed repair with you, explain what was done and why, and ensure your satisfaction before we leave.

## When to Repair vs. Replace Your Wilmington Roof

**Repair is the right choice when:**
- Damage is isolated to a specific area
- Your roof is under 15-20 years old
- Most shingles are still in good condition
- Total repair cost is well below replacement cost

**Replacement may make more sense when:**
- Multiple areas are failing simultaneously
- Your roof is nearing end of life
- Repeated repairs are adding up
- Major structural damage from storm

We'll give you an honest assessment of both options.
