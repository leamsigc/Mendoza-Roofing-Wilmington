          "@type": "Answer"
          text: "For Oak Island NC beach homes, we recommend metal roofing (standing seam or corrugated) for its outstanding wind resistance and salt air durability — lifespans of 40-70 years. Architectural asphalt shingles rated for 130+ mph winds are a cost-effective second option. Avoid standard 3-tab shingles in coastal environments. All metal components (flashing, vents, gutters) should be marine-grade or coated aluminum."

# Roofing Contractor on Oak Island, NC

Roofing a beach home on **Oak Island, NC** requires specialized knowledge and materials that go beyond standard residential roofing. The combination of salt air, high winds, intense UV exposure, and periodic tropical storms creates one of the most demanding roofing environments in North Carolina.

**Mendoza Roofing LLC** has been serving Oak Island and surrounding coastal Brunswick County communities since **1974**. We understand what it takes to build a roof that lasts for decades in this challenging environment.

## Why Coastal Oak Island Roofing Requires Specialists

### Salt Air Exposure
Salt in the air accelerates corrosion on all metal roofing components — nails, flashing, vents, gutters, and drip edges. We use **marine-grade or aluminum materials** on all coastal installations to prevent premature rust and failure.

### Hurricane & High Wind Risk
Oak Island sits directly on the Brunswick County coast and falls within hurricane impact zones. We recommend:
- **Wind-rated architectural shingles** (130 mph+) or standing seam metal as minimum standards
- Enhanced fastening patterns (6-nail application instead of standard 4-nail)
- Ice and water shield applied generously at all vulnerable areas

### UV & Heat Exposure
South-facing coastal roofs receive intense UV exposure year-round. We recommend materials with strong UV resistance ratings, and for some clients, **cool roof coatings** that reflect heat and reduce cooling costs.

### Metal Roofing for Oak Island Beach Homes

Following a tropical storm or hurricane, here's what to do:

1. **Don't climb your roof** — let professionals assess the damage safely

4. **We'll document for insurance** — our inspection report and estimate supports your claim
