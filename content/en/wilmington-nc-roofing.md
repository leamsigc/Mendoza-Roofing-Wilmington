## Roofing in Wilmington NC: What You Should Know

Wilmington's coastal location creates unique demands on roofs. Here is what every Wilmington homeowner should understand:

### Coastal Weather Challenges
- **High winds** from tropical storms and hurricanes require wind-rated shingles and secure fastening systems

- **Heavy annual rainfall** exposes any weakness in flashing, gutters, or shingles
- **UV exposure** in the southeastern sun ages roofing materials faster than inland areas

### Common Roofing Issues in Wilmington
- Shingle blow-off during storms
- Rust and corrosion on flashing and vents
- Nail pops and lifted shingles from thermal expansion
- Gutters pulling away from fascia
- Mold and algae growth on north-facing and shaded roof sections

### Best Roofing Materials for Wilmington NC
| Material | Lifespan | Wind Rating | Best For |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Architectural Shingles | 25-30 years | Up to 130 mph | Most Wilmington homes |
| Metal Roofing | 40-70 years | Up to 160 mph | Coastal properties |
