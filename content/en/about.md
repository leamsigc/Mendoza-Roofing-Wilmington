  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
    Founded in 1974, Mendoza Roofing has grown entirely through word of mouth and repeat customers — the strongest endorsement any local business can have. Over five decades, we've developed deep expertise in the specific roofing challenges of coastal North Carolina: salt air corrosion, hurricane-force winds, intense UV exposure, and heavy annual rainfall.
