## Our Emergency Roof Repair Response Process

### 1. Call Us Immediately
**[910-367-7628](tel:910-367-7628)** — available 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Tell us:
- Your name and address
- What damage you can see (photos helpful if safe to take)
- Whether water is actively entering the building

### 2. Safety First
While waiting for our crew, stay safe:
- Move furniture and valuables away from leaking areas
- Place buckets or containers to capture water
- Do NOT go on the roof yourself
- If structural damage is severe, consider evacuating

### 3. Emergency Tarping & Stabilization
Our first priority is **stopping the water intrusion**. We may apply emergency tarps or temporary coverings to protect your home while a full repair is planned.

### 4. Damage Documentation
We document all damage thoroughly — photos, descriptions, measurements — to support your insurance claim and provide an accurate repair estimate.

### 5. Permanent Repair or Replacement
Once the immediate emergency is stabilized, we schedule and complete the full permanent repair or replacement, working efficiently to restore your roof completely.

## Common Emergency Roof Situations in Wilmington NC

### Hurricane & Tropical Storm Damage
Wilmington sits in one of the most hurricane-active regions of the US East Coast. When a major storm hits, we mobilize quickly to help Wilmington homeowners:
- Emergency tarping for exposed homes
- Structural assessment and stabilization
- Insurance documentation support
- Full repair or replacement scheduling

### Wind Damage
Even non-hurricane winds of 50-70+ mph can displace shingles, tear off ridge caps, and lift flashing. High-wind damage is common in Wilmington's coastal environment.

### Tree Impact Damage
A fallen tree can instantly compromise your roof's structural integrity. This requires immediate professional assessment.

### Sudden Active Leaks
A pinhole leak that was "just a small drip" can become a flood after any significant rainfall. If your ceiling is staining or dripping, call immediately.

---

## What to Tell Your Insurance Company After Storm Damage

When you call your insurance company, they'll need:
1. Date and time of the storm or event
2. Description of visible damage
3. Whether there's interior water damage
4. Your claim number to provide to your contractor

Mendoza Roofing can prepare a detailed **written damage assessment and photo report** to accompany your insurance claim, helping ensure your claim is processed fairly.
