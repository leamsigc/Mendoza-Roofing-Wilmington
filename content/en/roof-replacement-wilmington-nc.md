# Roof Replacement in Wilmington, NC

Your roof is one of the most important investments you'll make in your home — and when it's time to replace it, you need a roofing company you can trust to do it right. **Mendoza Roofing LLC** has been completing **roof replacements in Wilmington NC** and throughout Brunswick County since **1974**.

We've replaced thousands of roofs across the Wilmington area and know exactly what it takes to build a roof that stands up to coastal North Carolina's demanding weather conditions.

## Signs You Need a Roof Replacement in Wilmington NC

Not sure if it's time to replace your roof? Here are the key warning signs:

- **Age**: Asphalt shingle roofs in coastal NC typically last 15-25 years (less than inland areas due to salt air and wind). If yours is over 20 years old, it's likely time.
- **Multiple leaks**: One isolated leak often means a localized repair. Multiple leaks in different areas signal broader failure.
- **Widespread shingle damage**: If shingles across your roof are curling, cracking, cupping, or losing granules, the entire roof is failing.
- **Sagging or soft spots**: Mean the decking underneath is rotted or compromised — a full replacement with decking repair is needed.
- **Granules in gutters**: End-of-life asphalt shingles shed their protective coating — you'll find it collecting in downspouts.
- **Rising energy bills**: A failing roof loses insulation efficiency, causing your HVAC to work harder.
- **Failed after storms**: If your roof was damaged after a recent storm and the remaining sections are also in poor condition, replacement is often better value than repair.
